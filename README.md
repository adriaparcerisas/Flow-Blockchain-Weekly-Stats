## Data Freshness
- **Last data week** = `MAX(TRUNC(block_timestamp, 'WEEK'))` across Flow **core** + **core_evm** (extendable to NFTs if desired).
- All weekly charts exclude the current in-progress week to avoid partials.
- **Cache TTL** is adjustable in the sidebar (default 300s). Increase TTL for heavy pages (e.g., user geography).

## Notes & Methodology

* **Weekly windowing** uses ISO truncation; ensure all comparisons align to `TRUNC(...,'WEEK')`.
* **Users by region** are inferred from hourly activity patterns (proxy for timezone) â€” treat as indicative, not exact.
* **EVM + Cadence merges** de-duplicate when needed (e.g., by tx id/hash) to avoid double counting.
* For cost/perf, prefer **narrow SELECTs**, reasonable **WHERE** clauses, and a higher **cache TTL** on heavy pages.
